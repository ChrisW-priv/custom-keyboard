# Custom keyboard
This project arrises from a need of mine for good quality, comfortable and cheap keyboard. 
From my research, there is no keyboard that satisfies all criterion. My dream keyboard type is way too expensive for me to buy. 
Luckily for me, I'm an engineer, so I can build it myself, for a fraction of the price.

## Requirements
I recently switched to Colemak as my layout so my keyboard has to support that natively.
Also, I am a softcore gamer, and most games are build with qwerty in mind. I want to be able to toggle the layouts quicly. 
Also, the standard keyboard is not comfortable, I'd like a keyboard that supports tilting. Also, the layout will be collumn staggered.
I often use the function keys, numbers and HOME, END, DELETE and ARROWS.
Finally, I want to try mechanical keyboard cuz I heard that it is easier to maintain/repair.

## Inspiration
I really like moonlander keyboard design, but it is way to pricey. I will use the thumb cluster idea and simmilar tilting mechanisms.
I also like the idea of macros. I don't use them now but want to be able to program someting in the keyboard.

## Final Details
Many controllers have analogue inputs. Although, I want to use Brown Switches now, I want the ability to switch them to optical and 
game on the keyboard with linear activation.

## Chosen layout
Keyboard Layout Editor ([link](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/)) is a tool to create custom keyboard layouts. 
Raw JSON data of layout I chose can be found in this repo.
